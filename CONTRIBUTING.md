## Install

To ensure consistency in our formatting we use `pre-commit` to check whether code was formatted properly and the documentation is up to date. On pull requests the CI checks whether all pre-commit hooks were run correctly.

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#post-commit)
2. Run `pre-commit install`
